<b># 09- Readme-Generator</b><br>
    When creating an open source project on GitHub, it’s important to have a high-quality README for the app. This should include what the app is for, how to use the app, how to install it, how to report issues, and how to make contributions—this last part increases the likelihood that other developers will contribute to the success of the project.

<b>All my programfiles and node js modules are inside the "Main" folder:</b><br>

Works i have done for this project:
1. Created the repository in the GitHub and cloned in to the local machine
2. Created .gitignore file using "touch .gitignore" command
3. Run two commands in the cmd prompt:- npm install and npm install inquirer
4. Updated .gitignore file with two contents, node_modules/ and .DS_Store - node_module and .DS_Store will not uploaded in to the github.
5. In this project there are two .js file: Index.js and generateMarkdown.js - Index.js contains all the questions and functions to write the answers to the README.MD file. generateMarkdown.js contains the Markdoun Template for the Readme file.
6. If we want to test the program, just type "node index.js" in the command line prompt. Before running the command, check the present working directory (PWD).In command line, if we are not in the exact folder, then the application will throw an error.
